  <p id="tribute-info"><span><a href="https://twitter.com/PhysInHistory/status/1667884207526297600" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</> was a man of many talents and quirks, one of which was his habit of picking locks and cracking safes. This hobby came to the forefront during his time working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during World War II.
When Feynman joined the project, it was the most secretive and critical endeavor of its time, aiming to develop the world's first atomic bomb. The high stakes led to a culture of strict security and confidentiality. Documents and notes were often locked away in safes, and employees were encouraged to lock their filing cabinets and desks.

Feynman, who was always eager to challenge his mind with puzzles and problems, found the atmosphere at Los Alamos perfect for practicing his lock-picking skills. It started as a lark but soon grew into a minor obsession. Feynman taught himself to pick locks, crack safes, and decipher combinations. He also developed a knack for finding patterns and weaknesses in the security measures that were supposed to keep the lab's secrets safe.

One of his most notorious escapades involved leaving cheeky notes in his colleagues' safes to alert them to their lack of security. Feynman would break into the safes, examine their contents, then leave a note that read something like, 
"Guess who?" 

This caused quite a stir and, of course, some amusement amongst the Los Alamos staff. It also led to some improvements in security!

Despite his antics, Feynman's actions were never malicious or intended to compromise the project. His lock picking was more about curiosity, testing security, and the sheer joy of solving puzzles. Feynman's lock-picking antics became part of the folklore of Los Alamos and contributed to his reputation as a beloved maverick in the world of physics.
